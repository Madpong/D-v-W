## Rationale

Throughout this course I have learned a lot, but in a way that is totally different from what I expected to learn. When I started here I expected a different kind of teaching. In the beginning I was very lost and it was hard to keep up. But little by little I have gotten used to developing the skills on my own in a very effective way. In this course I wanted to learn about real-time interactivity and how to code it. That&#39;s why I chose this final project. Because it focuses on real-time interactivity and programming. On the other hand I also wanted to learn more about graphic design in general, I come from a very technical world and many times I have missed that artistic touch that transforms the creations.

## Project concept

The project is focused on several issues that I want to bring together. Video Mapping, Video Games, Interactivity, Motion Tracking Camera (or other sources) and Real Life.

The goal is to connect, play and learn with people who don&#39;t know each other in open places.

To do this I will create a Net of recycled DVDs. On them I will project the game or different mini-games so that people who watch it can interact with the Wall through a camera that will capture their movement.

The game will be running on a local computer that will be connected by wifi to a Raspberry Pi where I will get the movement of people.

To develop this I will use Processing which gives me many real-time tools to play with different inputs and outputs both physical and virtual. Within processing I will use the p5.j libraries that will make it easier for me to integrate everything because I can run it directly in the browser. And inside p5.j I will have to look for different libraries related to Computer Vision, probably Kinect and others like Spout.On the other hand the game that I will use, will be an improved version of my previous project that I will have to modify to adapt them to the new technical requirements of this project. 

## Evaluation 

This time and not as in previous occasions in this course. I will go everywhere with a little notebook in which I will write down all my progress. I will also use it as a diary to make my self-criticism, assumptions and changes more visible.I will also have the time present at all times and will constantly adapt my initial objectives with my real present possibilities. |
